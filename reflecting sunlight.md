It isn't rocket science, it's just what I [publicly purposed](https://x.com/realMathewTyler/status/660967579972861952), and how long it took a **[team of scientists](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921854118 "Potential ecological impacts of climate intervention by reflecting sunlight to cool Earth")**  to purpose it; approximately **five years *after*** I had purposed it. 

As the clock continues to run, at the time of writing 9 years since when I purposed it, when have you considered such any easy solution? 10+ years after it was already purposed?
