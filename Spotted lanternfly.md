### Spotted lanternfly [Lycorma delicatula]
* **Method 1**: This is a two-part, "brute-force" system designed for speed, making it ideal for open areas like orchards. First, a large, inverted umbrella-like tarp is deployed around the tree's base. Then, a mechanical shaker clamps to the trunk and vibrates the entire tree, causing thousands of SLF to fall onto the tarp. The insects are then funneled into a container for disposal. This chemical-free method is extremely fast, capable of clearing a tree in under a minute. 
* **Method 2**: This method utilizes a single, autonomous robot that functions like a "sniper." It navigates various terrains, including cluttered residential yards, to locate individual SLF clusters using AI-powered cameras. A scissor lift and telescoping arm allow it to reach high into a tree's canopy and apply a targeted spray of soapy water. While this approach is highly precise and minimizes environmental impact, it is methodical and slower. The robot also experiences significant downtime as it must periodically return to a base station to refill its spray reservoir.
